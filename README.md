# Monzo Receipt Reader

We used Monzo’s API in conjunction with Azure’s Computer Vision API to analyse a photograph of a printed or handwritten receipt and extract individual items, quantities and prices. A digital version was then generated and automatically attached to the transaction in the Monzo app.
